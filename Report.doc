Project 2 Report

Protocol:
We decided to use Go-Back-N as our reliable data transfer protocol.

Header format:
We formulated packets with the following information:
		-type (data, ack, initiate file, request file);
    -server port number
    -client port number
    -sequence number
    -size in bytes
    -data
This was implemented as a struct in a header file, with enumerated types.

Timeouts:
-Measured by comparing the clock time to a global variable for the start time.

Implementation notes:
-Rebecca primarily worked on the sender, and Alec primarily worked on the receiver.
-Both aided in testing and debugging

Difficulties:
-Mixup in terminology for client/server and sender/receiver
		-Fixed by renaming files to sender.cpp and receiver.cpp
-Clilen initialization deleted by accident, causing errors in sending
